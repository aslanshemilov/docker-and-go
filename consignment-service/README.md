We are creating a microservice: a **shipping container management platform**. 

In traditional monolith applications, all of an organization's features are written into one single application. Sometimes they are grouped by their type, such as controllers, entities, factories, etc. Other times, in larger applicaitons, features are separated by concern or feature (may have an auth package, friends package, articles package, etc), which may concern their own factories, services, repositories, models, etc. Ultimately, however, they are grouped together in the same codebase.

A microservice is the concept of taking that second approach slightly further, and separating their concerns into their own, independent runnable codebase. Microservices are useful because we **reduce complexity**. Splitting features into microservices allows you to code in smaller chunks. Monoliths risk having some domains to become tightly coupled to each other and hard to separate. This could potentially lead to more bugs and such. Scalability refers to a system's ability to handle a growing amount of work and its potential to be enlarged to handle a growing amount of work. Microservices also allow us to **scale codebases separately**, whereas in a monolith you would have to scale the entire codebase. For instance, in a monolith, if one codebases is repeatedly experiencing issues, you would have to scale the entire codebase to attempt to fix the bug. With a microservice, you can simply probe into the specific codebase that is experiencing issues. **Therefore, microservices allow for you to have separation of individual services and more efficient horizontal scaling.**
