Golang is an open source programming language which is used to build simple, reliable and efficient more quickly. What is golang? It was formed by combining the performance and security benefits of C++ and includes the speed of Python.

Features Of Go Programming Language
The main character of the Go language is: –

• Cloud Computing: – Datacenter and the clouds are not same. The cloud offers servers on demand. You can let auto-scaling turn the knobs on you. While scaling the instances some of the machine takes a long time to run and parse through every line of code. Go applications can be quickly launched and efficiently respond to servers so that the programming may go faster.

• Multicore Performance: – Go is a scalable language and includes straightforward model, so we don’t need to rewrite our software for additional cores. It doubles the number of cores on a regular basis.

• Microservices: – Use asynchronous input-output for make application to be interactive with some services without blocking web requests. Go helps in building applications as a collection of microservices.

• The Fat Client Renaissance: –  Go language don’t need to be tied with frameworks of yore. It can work with writing APIs and favors an excellent support for multiple clients. It can build the API and then make it flexible for the customers.
• Non-Synchronous: –  Go language runs smoothly on all operating systems and doesn’t block others. Its code is non-synchronous style so that there is no need for callbacks.

• Concurrency: – Go language provides a concurrency primitive comparable to the actors model. These players models help in naming endpoints of the channels.

• Static Binaries: – Go language has no static boundaries. It can be quickly compiled and launched immediately.
